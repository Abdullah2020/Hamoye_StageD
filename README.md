# Hamoye_StageD

In the part 2 of Stage_D Hamoye summer internship project, we built artificial intelligence algorithms to label satellite image chips with different atmospheric conditions and the different classes of land cover/land use.  For this Multi-class Multi-Label problem, some of the labels are from the following categories: 
*   Cloud Cover (clear, partly, cloudy, haze)
*   Primary RainForest, Water (rivers, lakes)
*   Habitation (large city, small homes)
*   Agriculture,
*   Roads etc. 

The algorithms from this project will enable us to understand where, how and why deforestation happens.
